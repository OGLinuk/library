<h2 id="put">PUT</h2>
<p>The difference between a PUT and a POST is subtle. They are virtually identical transmissions except for the different method strings. Where POST is meant to pass on data to a remote resource, PUT is supposed to be the new version of that resource.</p>
<p>In that aspect, PUT is similar to good old standard file upload found in other protocols. You upload a new version of the resource with PUT. The URL identifies the resource and you point out the local file to put there:</p>
<pre><code>curl -T localfile http://example.com/new/resource/file</code></pre>
<p>â€¦so -T will imply a PUT and tell curl which file to send off. But the similarities between POST and PUT also allows you to send a PUT with a string by using the regular curl POST mechanism using <code>-d</code> but asking for it to use a PUT instead:</p>
<pre><code>curl -d &quot;data to PUT&quot; -X PUT http://example.com/new/resource/file</code></pre>
