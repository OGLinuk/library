<p>macOS comes with the curl tool bundled with the operating system since many years. If you want to upgrade to the latest version shipped by the curl project, we recommend installing <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> (a macOS software package manager) and then install the curl package from them:</p>
<pre><code>brew install curl</code></pre>
