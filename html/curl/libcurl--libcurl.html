<h2 id="curl-libcurl">curl â€“libcurl</h2>
<p>We actively encourage users to first try out the transfer they want to do with the curl command-line tool, and once it works roughly the way you want it to, you append the <code>--libcurl [filename]</code> option to the command line and run it again.</p>
<p>The <code>--libcurl</code> command-line option will create a C program in the provided file name. That C program is an application that uses libcurl to run the transfer you just had the curl command-line tool do. There are some exceptions and it is not always a 100% match, but you will find that it can serve as an excellent inspiration source for what libcurl options you want or can use and what additional arguments to provide to them.</p>
<p>If you specify the filename as a single dash, as in <code>--libcurl -</code> you will get the program written to stdout instead of a file.</p>
<p>As an example, we run a command to just get http://example.com:</p>
<pre><code>curl http://example.com --libcurl example.c</code></pre>
<p>This creates <code>example.c</code> in the current directory, looking similar to this:</p>
